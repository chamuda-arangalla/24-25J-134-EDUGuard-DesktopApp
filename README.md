# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
In online learning environments, students often experience stress due to various factors such as workload, deadlines, and lack of direct interaction with peers and instructors.
 However, detecting stress in real-time is challenging because there are no widely available automated systems for monitoring students’ emotional states.
  As a result, students may struggle to manage their stress effectively, which can negatively impact their learning outcomes. This situation presents several key challenges:

➢ How to accurately detect stress levels in students during online learning sessions?  
➢ How to provide real-time stress monitoring without interrupting the learning process?  
➢ How to ensure privacy and security while collecting facial expression data?  
➢ How to integrate stress detection with personalized recommendations for stress management?  
➢ How to make the system accessible and easy to use for both students and educators?  

```

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
To develop a reliable and user-friendly stress detection system that utilizes facial expressions captured through a webcam to identify stress levels in students during online learning.
 The system will leverage deep learning techniques to classify emotions, providing real-time feedback and personalized stress management recommendations,
  thereby enhancing students' well-being and academic performance.
