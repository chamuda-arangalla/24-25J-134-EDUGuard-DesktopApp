### Main objective 
To develop a system that uses geospatial data and modern technologies to ensure foreign tourists in Sri Lanka receive fair and transparent pricing for adventure and leisure activities, fostering trust between tourists and local vendors while supporting the growth of the tourism economy.

### Sub Objectives
* To identify and classify common poor sitting postures.
* To integrate non-wearable sensors into the posture detection system.
* To develop an algorithm that can differentiate between temporary and sustained poor postures, providing feedback only when necessary.
* To evaluate the system’s effectiveness in different environments (e.g., home, library, and classroom settings).
* To assess user compliance and comfort while using the posture detection system over an extended period.
* To analyze the long-term health impact of using the posture detection system among online learning students.
