# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```After COVID-19, online learning became the norm, leading to a surge in screen time among students. Increased digital device usage has amplified cases of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), characterized by eye strain, dryness, headaches, and blurred vision.
Impact on Health and Productivity

1.	Eye Health Issues – Prolonged screen exposure reduces blink rate, causing dry eyes and irritation.
2.	Mental Fatigue – Continuous screen engagement increases cognitive load, leading to fatigue and reduced concentration.
3.	Reduced Academic Performance – Eye discomfort and headaches hinder focus, reading speed, and retention ability.
Limitations of Traditional Diagnostic Methods
1.	Lack of Real-Time Monitoring – Traditional methods rely on self-reported symptoms, which may be inconsistent.
2.	No Continuous Tracking – Most check-ups are periodic, failing to detect gradual CVS development.
3.	One-Size-Fits-All Solutions – Generic advice (e.g., "take breaks") doesn't consider individual screen habits.
4.	Limited Accessibility – Many students lack access to eye care specialists, delaying early intervention.

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
•	How can a system accurately detect eye fatigue caused by prolonged screen use using real-time monitoring techniques?
•	What methods can be implemented to effectively provide timely alerts to users to mitigate the impact of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)?
•	How can user behavior and environmental factors be analyzed to offer personalized recommendations for reducing CVS symptoms?
Specific Objective
•	Develop a desktop application to monitor eye strain, blinking, and screen distance in real-time, providing alerts and insights to reduce Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) symptoms.

Sub Objectives
•	Detect Eye Fatigue Level and Blinking Frequency
•	Detect User's Face and Distance from Screen
•	Capture Screen Time Duration
•	Train an Eye State Detection Model

This diagram illustrates a Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) detection system that uses a webcam to monitor a user's eye behavior. The system captures video input, identifies and analyzes eye movements, and then processes the data to determine potential signs of CVS, such as reduced blinking or excessive screen time. Based on the analysis, it generates an output and notifies the user if a break or adjustment is needed, helping to prevent eye strain and discomfort.
